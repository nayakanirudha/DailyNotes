What Computers See?

Images are numbers , Pixels -> Matric of 2D
High level Feature Extraction 
Manual ? Domain Knowledge + Define Feature + Detect Feature
Automatic ? Learn hierarchy of features directly from data 

Learning Visual Features

Dense Neural Network -  Fully Connected Neural Networks
2D Image -> 1D Vector (Loss of spatial information so not feasible)
Can we put spatial structure in Neural Networks ?
Connect a patch of input to neurons
Slide the window over the image
Patchy operation is called Convolution 

Feature Extraction and Convolution

Pass the filter over a patch
Element wise multiply patch with filter and add outputs
Closer the patch matches filter , higher the output

CNN

Feature Learning - Convolution -> Non Linearity -> Pooling(Down Sampling)
	- Apply window of weights
	- Compute linear combination (along with bias)
	- Activate non linear function
	- Output will be a volume of image and each sheet of that volume is the output obtained after passing the image over 1 filter. Depth of Volume will be number of filters
	- Apply non linearity (ReLU)
	- Max Pool ( Max in Patch ) to reduce dimensionality and Spatial Invariance - Any Alternatives ?
	- Flatten the Volume
	- Feed it to the Dense Layer which will use Softmax to give out a class.
